# movie-boooking-application
A backend application for managing movie ticket bookings, built with Spring Boot. This project demonstrates secure RESTful API development using modern Java technologies and best practices.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- 🎟️ Book, cancel, and view movie tickets
- 🛡️ Role-based access control with Spring Security
- 📦 Data persistence using JPA and Hibernate
- 🔍 API testing and validation via Postman
- 📘 (Coming Soon) Swagger UI for interactive API documentation

Code

## 🔐 Authentication

- JWT tokens are issued upon successful login.
- Protected endpoints require a valid token in the `Authorization` header.
- Role-based access ensures only authorized users can perform specific actions.

## 📮 API Testing

All endpoints have been tested using Postman. Sample collections and environment files can be found in the `/postman` folder (if included).

## 📘 Swagger Integration (Planned)

To enhance developer experience, Swagger UI will be added for:
- Visualizing and testing endpoints
- Auto-generating API documentation

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-booking-app.git
   cd movie-booking-app
Configure your database in application.properties.

Run the application:

bash
mvn spring-boot:run
Access the API via Postman or Swagger (once integrated).

📌 Future Enhancements
Add Swagger UI for better API visibility

Implement email notifications for bookings

Add unit and integration tests

Deploy to cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
